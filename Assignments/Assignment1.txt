exercises 1 + 2 authored by Allan Downey - Think Python 


1. 
Python provides a built-in function called len that returns the length of a string, 
so the value of len(‘bell’) is 4. 
Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named s as a parameter and 
prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter 
of the string is in column 70 of the display. 


2. 
Using only what we have learned so far, write a function that draws a grid like the following:

+ - - - - + - - - - +
|	  |	    |
|	  | 	    |
|	  |	    |
|	  | 	    |
+ - - - - + - - - - +
|	  |	    | 
|	  | 	    |
|	  | 	    | 
| 	  | 	    | 
+ - - - - + - - - - + 


3. 
Create a function that generates a python list of all the even numbers between 4 and 30 (Hint: python has a built in function called range() that may be useful).
