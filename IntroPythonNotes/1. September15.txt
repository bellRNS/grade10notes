September 15 notes. 

First you downloaded python. 

Then you opened python (IDLE)

Python is simple in its language. 

Use as a calculator. 

Operators (math)
	+ is add 
	- is subtract 
	* is multiply
	/ is divide 
	** is exponent
	square root is **(1/2)

examples: 
>>> 4 + 4
8
>>> 6007*4042
24280294

Please calculate the area of a sphere with radius 5. 


numbers can be integers or 'floats'
int - no decimal (example 2)
float - have a decimal (example 4.2)

>>> type(4.0)
<class 'float'>

Errors sometimes happen if you use the wrong data type. 

Can convert between types, as follows: 
>>> int(4.0)
4

>>> float(4)
4.0

STRINGS 
Strings are just text. 
They require quotations.
>>> 'hey owen!'
'hey owen!'


You can also add strings, this is called concatenation. 




VARIABLES 
-can be numbers
>>> x=4
>>> x
4
This allows you to 'store' information

You can also 'mess' with that information! 
>>> x * 1000
4000

variables can be updated:
x = 4
x = 10000
now x is equal to 1000, not 4. 

print helps us see what's going on. 
print('what you want to print')

you can change integers into strings! 
str(x) (where x is a integer)

QUESTIONS:
Assume that we execute the following assignment statements (variables).
>>>width = 17 
>>>height = 12.0
>>>delimiter='.'

for each of the following, write the resulting expression and the type of value given. 
1. width/2
2. width/2.0
3. height/3
4. 1 + 2 * 5 
5. delimiter * 5

Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95 but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies.
